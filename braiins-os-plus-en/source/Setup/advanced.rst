====================================  ============================================================
load                                  load the current configuration of the miners (specified in 
                                      the CSV file) and insert them to the CSV file
save                                  save the settings from the CSV file to the miners 
                                      (this does not apply them)
apply                                 apply the settings, which were copied from the CSV file to 
                                      the miners

                                      report button is pressed)
====================================  ============================================================

**Example:**

::

  ./bos-toolbox.exe discover scan 10.10.10.0/24

This command will scan the network in the range 10.10.10.0 - 10.10.10.255 and list the found miners, with their IP addresses.

.. _web_package:
***********
Web Package
***********

The Web package can be used to switch from stock firmware that was released before 2019. It should also work on other stock-based firmwares. This package cannot be used on stock firmware that was released in 2019 and later because the signature verification that was implemented prevents the usage of 3rd party firmwares.

=====
Usage
=====

  * Download the **Web Package** from our `website <https://braiins-os.com/>`_.
  * Follow the sections below

=======================================
Features, PROs and CONs of this method:
=======================================

  + replaces stock firmware with Braiins OS+ without additional tools
  + migrates the network configuration
  + migrates pool URLs, users, and passwords
  + turns on autotuning with default power limit (1420W)
  
  - cannot be used on stock firmware released in 2019 and later
  - cannot configure the installation (e.g. it will always migrate the network settings)
  - no batch-mode (unless you create your own scripts)

.. _web_package_install:
=====================================
Install Braiins OS+ using Web package
=====================================

  * Download the **Web Package** from our `website <https://braiins-os.com/>`_.
  * Login on your miner and go to the section *System -> Upgrade* in the web interface.
  * Upload the downloaded package and flash the image.

.. _sd:
*************
SD card image
*************

If you are running stock firmware that was released in 2019 and later, the only way to install Braiins OS+ is to insert an SD card with Braiins OS+ flashed on it. In 2019, the SSH connection was locked and the signature verification in the web interface prevents the usage of 3rd party firmwares.

=====
Usage
=====

  * Download the **SD card image** from our `website <https://braiins-os.com/>`_.
  * Follow the sections bellow

=======================================
Features, PROs and CONs of this method:
=======================================

  + replaces SSH locked stock firmware with Braiins OS+
  + uses the network configuration stored on the NAND (this can be turned off, see the section *Network settings* below)
  + turns on autotuning on default power limit (1420W)
  
  - does not migrate pool URLs, users, and passwords
  - no batch-mode

.. _sd_install:
=================================
Install Braiins OS+ using SD card
=================================

 * Download the SD card image from our `website <https://braiins-os.com/>`_.
 * Flash the downloaded image on an SD card (e.g. using `Etcher <https://etcher.io/>`_). *Note: Simple copy to SD card will not work. The SD card has to be flashed!*
 * Adjust the jumpers to boot from SD card (instead of NAND memory), as shown below.

  .. |pic1| image:: ../_static/s9-jumpers.png
      :width: 45%
      :alt: S9 Jumpers

  .. |pic2| image:: ../_static/s9-jumpers-board.png
      :width: 45%
      :alt: S9 Jumpers Board

  |pic1|  |pic2|

 * Insert the SD card into the device, then start the device.
 * After a moment, you should be able to access the Braiins OS+ interface through the device’s IP address.
 * *[Optional]:* You can now install Braiins OS+ to the NAND (see the section :ref:`sd_nand_install`)

.. _sd_network:
================
Network settings
================
 
By default, the network configuration stored on the NAND is used while running Braiins OS+ from an SD card. This feature can be turned off by following the steps bellow:

  * Mount the first FAT partition of the SD card
  * Open the file uEnv.txt and insert the following string (make sure there is only one string per line)

  ::

    cfg_override=no

Disabling usage of old network settings is beneficial for users that have problems with the miner not being visible in the network (e.g. static IP address used on NAND is out of range of the network). By doing so, DHCP is used.

.. _sd_nand_install:
============
NAND install
============

The SD card can be used to replace the firmware running on NAND with Braiins OS+. This can be done either:
  * using the web interface - section *System -> Install current system to device (NAND)*
  * using the *miner* tool, via SSH - follow this section of the guide :ref:`opkg_nand_install`

.. _sd_factory_reset:
=======================================
Braiins OS+ factory reset using SD card
=======================================

You can do a factory reset by following the steps bellow:

  * Mount the first FAT partition of the SD card
  * Open the file uEnv.txt and insert the following string (make sure there is only one string per line)

  ::

    factory_reset=yes

.. _ssh_package:
****************************
Remote (SSH) install package
****************************

With the *Remote (SSH) install package* you can install or uninstall Braiins OS+. This method is not recommended, as it requires a Python setup. The BOS+ Toolbox is more user-friendly.

=====
Usage
=====

  * Download the **Remote (SSH) install package** from our `website <https://braiins-os.com/>`_.
  * Follow the sections bellow

=======================================
Features, PROs and CONs of this method:
=======================================

  + installs Braiins OS+ remotely
  + uninstalls Braiins OS+ remotely
  + migrates the whole configuration by default (can be adjusted) when installing Braiins OS+
  + migrates the network configuration by default (can be adjusted) when uninstalling Braiins OS+
  + parameters are available to customize the process
  + turns on autotuning with default power limit (1420W) when installing Braiins OS+
  
  - no batch-mode (unless you create your own scripts)
  - requires a long setup
  - does not work on miners with locked SSH

.. _ssh_package_environment:
=========================
Preparing the environment
=========================

First, you need to prepare the Python environment. This consists of the following steps:

* *(Only Windows)* Install *Ubuntu for Windows 10* available from the Microsoft Store `here. <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6>`_
* Run the following commands in your command line terminal:

*(Note that the commands are compatible with Ubuntu and Ubuntu for Windows 10. If you are using a different distribution of Linux or a different OS, please check the corresponding documentation and edit the commands as necessary.)*

(TODO: update links, paths) 
::

  #Update the repositories and install dependencies
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-virtualenv virtualenv
  
  #Download and extract the firmware package
  wget -c https://feeds.braiins-os.com/20.03/braiins-os-plus_am1-s9_ssh_2019-02-21-0-572dd48c_2020-03-29-1-6b4a0f46.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz
  
  #Change the directory to the unpacked firmware folder
  cd ./braiins-os_am1-s9_ssh_2019-02-21-0-572dd48c_2020-03-29-1-6b4a0f46
  
  #Create a virtual environment and activate it
  virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 .env && source .env/bin/activate
  
  #Install the required Python packages
  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

.. _ssh_package_install:
=====================================
Install Braiins OS+ using SSH package
=====================================

Installation of Braiins OS+ using the so-called *SSH Method* consists of the following steps:

* *(Custom Firmware)* Flash stock firmware. This step can be skipped if the device is running on stock firmware or on a previous versions of Braiins OS. *(Note: It is possible that Braiins OS+ can be installed directly over a custom firmware, but as they differ from the stock version, it might be necessary to flash stock firmware first.)*
* *(Only Windows)* Install *Ubuntu for Windows 10* available from the Microsoft Store `here. <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6>`_
* Prepare the Python environment, which is described in the section :ref:`ssh_package_environment`.
* Run the following commands in your command line terminal (replace the placeholder ``IP_ADDRESS`` accordingly) :

*(Note that the commands are compatible with Ubuntu and Ubuntu for Windows 10. If you are using a different distribution of Linux or a different OS, please check the corresponding documentation and edit the commands as necessary.)*

::

  #Change the directory to the unpacked firmware folder (if not already in the firmware folder)
  cd ./braiins-os_am1-s9_ssh_2019-02-21-0-572dd48c_2020-03-29-1-6b4a0f46
  
  #Activate the virtual environment (if it is not already activated)
  source .env/bin/activate
  
  #Run the script to install Braiins OS+
  python3 upgrade2bos.py IP_ADDRESS

.. _ssh_package_uninstall:
=======================================
Uninstall Braiins OS+ using SSH package
=======================================

.. _ssh_package_uninstall_image:
Using factory firmware image
=============================

First, you need to prepare the Python environment, which is described in the section :ref:`ssh_package_environment`.

On an Antminer S9, you can flash a factory firmware image
from the manufacturer’s website, with ``FACTORY_IMAGE`` being file path
or URL to the ``tar.gz`` (not extracted!) file. Supported images with
corresponding MD5 hashes are listed in the
`platform.py <https://github.com/braiins/braiins/blob/master/braiins-os/upgrade/am1/platform.py>`__
file.

Run (replace the placeholders ``FACTORY_IMAGE`` and ``IP_ADDRESS`` accordingly):

::

  cd ~/braiins-os_am1-s9_ssh_2019-02-21-0-572dd48c_2020-03-29-1-6b4a0f46 && source .env/bin/activate
  python3 restore2factory.py --factory-image FACTORY_IMAGE IP_ADDRESS

.. _ssh_package_uninstall_backup:
Using previously created backup
===============================

First, you need to prepare the Python environment, which is described in the section :ref:`ssh_package_environment`.

If you created a backup of the original firmware during the installation of Braiins OS+, you can restore it by using the following commands (replace the placeholders ``BACKUP_ID_DATE`` and ``IP_ADDRESS`` accordingly):

::

  cd ~/braiins-os_am1-s9_ssh_2019-02-21-0-572dd48c_2020-03-29-1-6b4a0f46 && source .env/bin/activate
  python3 restore2factory.py backup/BACKUP_ID_DATE/ IP_ADDRESS

**Note: This method is not recommended as the backup creation is very finicky. The backup can be corrupted and there is no way to check it. Use at your own risk and make sure you can access the miner and insert an SD card to it in case the restoration does not finish successfully!**

.. _opkg:
****
OPKG
****

OPKG commands can be used after connecting to the miner via SSH. There are many OPKG commands, but the only ones that are relevant with Braiins OS+ are the following:

  * *opkg update* - updates the package lists. It's recommended to use this command before other OPKG commands.
  * *opkg install PACKAGE_NAME* install the defined package. It's recommended to use *opkg update* to update the package lists before installing packages.
  * *opkg remove PACKAGE_NAME*

Since the firmware change results in a reboot, the following
output is expected:

::

  ...
  Collected errors:
  * opkg_conf_load: Could not lock /var/lock/opkg.lock: Resource temporarily unavailable.
    Saving config files...
    Connection to 10.10.10.1 closed by remote host.
    Connection to 10.10.10.1 closed.

=======================================
Features, PROs and CONs of this method:
=======================================

  + update Braiins OS+ remotely
  + switch to Braiins OS+ from other versions remotely
  + revert to the initial version of Braiins OS remotely
  + migrates the configuration and continue to mine without a need to configure anything (when updating or switching to Braiins OS+)
  
  - no batch-mode (unless you create your own scripts)

.. _opkg_update:
=============================
Update Braiins OS+ using OPKG
=============================

With OPKG, you can easily update your current installation of Braiins OS+ by connecting to the miner via SSH and using the following commands:

::

  opkg update
  opkg install firmware

  #you can also connect to the miner and run the commands at the same time
  ssh root@IP_ADDRESS "opkg update && opkg install firmware"

This will migrate the configuration and continue to mine without a need to configure anything.

.. _opkg_switch_to_braiinsplus:
====================================================
Switch to Braiins OS+ from other versions using OPKG
====================================================

With OPKG, you can easily switch to Braiins OS+ by connecting to the miner via SSH and using the following commands:

::

  opkg update
  opkg install firmware

  #you can also connect to the miner and run the commands at the same time
  ssh root@IP_ADDRESS "opkg update && opkg install bos_plus"

This will migrate the configuration and continue to mine without a need to configure anything. Default power limit will be set (1420W).

.. _opkg_factory_reset:
====================================
Braiins OS+ factory reset using OPKG
====================================

With OPKG, you can easily revert to the initial version of Braiins OS (i.e. the version first installed on the device) by connecting to the miner via SSH and using the following commands:

::

  opkg update
  opkg remove firmware

  #you can also connect to the miner and run the commands at the same time
  ssh root@IP_ADDRESS "opkg update && opkg remove firmware"

This will reset the configuration to the state after the first Braiins OS installation.

.. _sysupgrade:
******************
Sysupgrade package
******************

Sysupgrade is used to upgrade the system running on the device. With this method, you can install various versions of Braiins OS or create a backup of the system. It's recommended to use the *Braiins OS web interface* or *opkg install firmware* instead of this method, as they are more user-friendly.

=====
Usage
=====

In order to use sysupgrade, you need to connect to the miner via SSH. The syntax is the following:

::

  sysupgrade [parameters] <image file or URL>

The most important parameters are **--help** (to display the help) and **-F** to force the installation. It's not recommended to use this method (besides the way that it is described below) unless you really know what you are doing.

=======================================
Features, PROs and CONs of this method:
=======================================

  + installs various version of Braiins OS while connected to the miner
  + migrates the configuration
  + parameters are available to customize the process
  
  - no batch-mode (unless you create your own scripts)
  - cannot switch to an older version of Braiins OS (released before 2020)

.. _sysupgrade_switch_braiinsos:
==============================================================================
Switch to Braiins OS (without autotuning) from other versions using Sysupgrade
==============================================================================

In order to upgrade from older version of Braiins OS or downgrade from Braiins OS+, use the following command (replace the placeholder ``IP_ADDRESS`` accordingly):

(TODO: update link)
::

  ssh root@IP_ADDRESS 'wget -O /tmp/firmware.tar https://feeds.braiins-os.org/am1-s9/firmware_2020-03-29-0-6ec1a631_arm_cortex-a9_neon.tar && sysupgrade /tmp/firmware.tar'

This command contains the following commands: 

  * **ssh** - to connect to the miner
  * **wget** - used for downloading files, in this case the firmware package
  * **sysupgrade** - to actually flash the downloaded firmware package

.. _sysupgrade_switch_braiinsplus:
==========================================================
Switch to Braiins OS+ from other versions using Sysupgrade
==========================================================

In order to upgrade from older version of Braiins OS, use the following command (replace the placeholder ``IP_ADDRESS`` accordingly):

(TODO: update link)
::

  ssh root@IP_ADDRESS 'wget -O /tmp/firmware.tar https://feeds.braiins-os.org/am1-s9/firmware_2020-03-29-0-6ec1a631_arm_cortex-a9_neon.tar && sysupgrade /tmp/firmware.tar'

This command contains the following commands: 

  * **ssh** - to connect to the miner
  * **wget** - used for downloading files, in this case the firmware package
  * **sysupgrade** - to actually flash the downloaded firmware package

Note: It's recommended to use the *BOS+ Toolbox*, *Braiins OS web interface* or *opkg install bos_plus* instead of this method.

.. _bos2bos:
**************
Bos2Bos script
**************

**It's not recommend to use the Bos2Bos script unless you experience problems with the installation using the other methods.** This method only works if Braiins OS is already running on the device.

=======================================
Features, PROs and CONs of this method:
=======================================

  + installs any version of Braiins OS remotely
  + install a clean version of Braiins OS
  + parameters are available to customize the process
  
  - no batch-mode (unless you create your own scripts)

=====
Usage
=====

Usage of the Bos2Bos script requires the following setup:

* *(Only Windows)* Install *Ubuntu for Windows 10* available from the Microsoft Store `here. <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6>`_
* Run the following commands in your command line terminal:

*(Note that the commands are compatible with Ubuntu and Ubuntu for Windows 10. If you are using a different distribution of Linux or a different OS, please check the corresponding documentation and edit the commands as necessary.)*
